            <span id="title">Catcher In The Rye, J.D. Salinger, 1951.</span>
            I read this book sometime in 2023. I found it to be a pain in the ass becuase the protagonist
            Holden Caufield, is such a downer, but I think that this book helped me understand my own 
            cynicism down the road. I think this book hold an important role in understanding teenage minds even today.

            <span id="title">Why We're Polarized, Ezra Klien, 2020.</span>
            The summer of 2025, Zohran Mamdani ran for the demoncratic nominee for the NYC mayoral primaries. I began to feel 
            a bit more hopeful, like someone was fighting for what I too belived in. I started engaging heavily with politcs. 
            This book hleped me understand the ways in which the United States goverment functions, in a conceptual way. It gave
            me important skills to analyze national issues.

            <span id="title">Dune, Frank Herbert, 1965.</span>
           This book made me realize the wonders of science fiction. My Dad loves Dune, it was nice to discuss the book with him.
           Regardless, I still loved the book on it's own. I love how it takes you out of your own world completley. I like how the themes
           in Dune are similar to the political tribulations we see today.

            <span id="title">The Right to Sex, Amia Srinivasan, 2021.</span>
           This book introduced me to intersectional feminism on a deeper level. Prior to this book I had only engaged in feminist theroy on 
           a very surface level. It was hard to see myself inside feminism. This book allowed me to see how I relate to the movement, and understnad it 
           on a much more complex level. After reading this book, I went on to read many, many others.

            <span id="title">Slaughter House Five, Kurt Vonnegut, 1969.</span>
           I don't think there are enough words to explain how much this book blew my mind at 16, and how it still does upon each re-read. This book taught me 
           about so much. If you are anti-war. Please read. "Everything was beautiful and nothing mattered." -Kurt Vonnegut
